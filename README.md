<h1> Installation Instructions </h1>

1. Download the project
2. Unzip and clone the repository to your workspace
3. Install Node.js (if needed)
4. Unzip node_modules.zip to the same folder it is located (right click then Extract Here)
5. Open cmd and change directories to the location of the repository
6. Run node index.js to start the server
7. Open a web browser and travel to: localhost:3000 or localhost:portNumber where portNumber is the port the server is listening on
8. Select a user to begin testing (I also left a easy way for you to send gifts on the homepage to make testing easier)

The server will post logs to help inform when something is or isnt a success
